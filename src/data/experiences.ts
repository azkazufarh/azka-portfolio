        I contributed to several laboratory-related digital systems aimed
        at improving operational efficiency and user experience. For the
        Laboratory Website Dashboard, I enhanced the user interface to
        ensure consistency across the platform, conducted routine
        maintenance, resolved system bugs, and implemented robust form
        validation features to maintain data integrity during consumable
        item submissions. In the Training Center for Laboratory, I
        designed an intuitive user interface from scratch using Figma,
        specifically tailored to laboratory training workflows. The
        application was developed using ASP.NET with a focus on
        performance and scalability, including backend services optimized
        for efficient data processing and retrieval. Throughout the
        development, I prioritized both user experience and system
        reliability. For the Quality Assurance Logbook, I created custom
        Excel Macros to streamline QA testing procedures in a chemical
        laboratory environment and utilized SQL queries to provide dynamic
        data access based on user needs. I also developed a responsive
        logbook interface that supported efficient tracking and reporting
        for QA users. Additionally, in the Datasheet Testing for
        Laboratory project, I refined data collection methods to enhance
        result accuracy, consolidated various test processes into a single
        scalable workbook, and ensured compliance by maintaining and
        updating validation procedures in line with evolving product
        requirements.

        I developed secure REST APIs using Python and Flask, incorporating
        an ORM to facilitate seamless database interactions and
        implementing data encryption to enhance user security. As part of
        the project, I integrated the system with a LLaMA2-based chatbot,
        utilizing server-side rendering to deliver accurate and
        context-aware responses. Additionally, I designed and optimized
        PostgreSQL databases, resulting in improved query performance and
        overall system efficiency.
